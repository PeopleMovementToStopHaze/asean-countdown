The clock is ticking. This countdown clock reminds us of time left from 29 Oct 2020 to haze-free ASEAN, according to the leaders’ commitment.
PM.Haze will keep track of the milestones of ASEAN government actions and inactions. The ASEAN people will support in all possible ways, so that in 2020, we can declare victory over haze.
